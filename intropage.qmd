INTRO


Hi everyone, I completed my bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering at VNRVJIET, Hyderabad, India and am currently pursuing my masters in Data Analytical Engineering at George Mason University. Besides STAT 515 I've enrolled in AIT 580 and CS 504. Through this course, 
I would like to develop a strong understanding of big data fundamentals and gain hands-on experience with big data and visualization tools. 
During my bachelor's degree, I was engaged in programming languages such as C, Python, and R.
